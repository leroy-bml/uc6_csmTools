\title{Generate an Experimental Design Code from a DSSAT management table list}
\usage{
make_expd_code(dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A named list of data frames, including at least \code{"TREATMENTS"} and \code{"FERTILIZERS"}.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the experimental design code.
}
\description{
Constructs a compact code describing the experimental design, based on treatment and fertilizer structure, using ICASA abbreviations.
}
\details{
The function maps treatment headers to ICASA abbreviations, removes managements with only one level, and groups columns by their sequence of levels. It then constructs a code summarizing the experimental design, indicating the number of levels and the management types involved. If fertilization is a treatment, the code includes the focal nutrient(s) (e.g., "FE(N)" for nitrogen).

This code is useful for summarizing and comparing experimental designs in a standardized way.

The function uses \code{map_headers} and \code{load_map} for header mapping.
