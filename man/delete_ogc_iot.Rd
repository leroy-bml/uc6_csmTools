\title{Delete a Resource from an OGC SensorThings API Endpoint}
\usage{
delete_ogc_iot(
  object = c("Things", "Sensors", "ObservedProperties", "Datastreams", "Observations"),
  object_id,
  url,
  token
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Character. The type of resource to delete. Must be one of \code{c("Things", "Sensors", "ObservedProperties", "Datastreams", "Observations")}.}

\item{object_id}{The unique identifier of the resource to delete.}

\item{url}{Character. The base URL of the OGC SensorThings API endpoint (should end with a slash).}

\item{token}{Character. The Bearer token for authentication.}
}
\value{
The response object from the DELETE request (an \code{httr::response} object).
}
\description{
Sends a DELETE request to an OGC SensorThings API endpoint to remove a specified resource (e.g., Thing, Sensor, ObservedProperty, Datastream, or Observation) by its ID.
}
\details{
This function constructs the full URL for the resource by appending the resource type (\code{object}) and the resource ID (\code{object_id}) in OData format to the base URL. It then sends a DELETE request to this URL, including the provided Bearer token for authentication.

The function checks that the URL starts with \code{http://} or \code{https://} and stops with an error if not.

The function uses the \strong{httr} package for HTTP requests.
