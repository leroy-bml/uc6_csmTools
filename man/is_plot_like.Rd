\title{Check if a Column is Plot-Like}
\usage{
is_plot_like(df, col_name, year_col_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the data to be checked.}

\item{col_name}{The name of the column to test for plot-likeness (as a string).}

\item{year_col_name}{The name of the year column (as a string).}
}
\value{
Logical. \code{TRUE} if the column is plot-like, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Determines whether a column in a data frame is "plot-like" based on several criteria:
\enumerate{
\item Plot IDs are uniquely represented within each year (no duplicates within a year).
\item At least one plot ID is repeated across all years (i.e., there is at least one plot present in every year).
\item The column has the highest number of distinct values (modalities) within each year, compared to other non-primary-key columns.
}
The function returns \code{TRUE} if the column satisfies either criterion 1 or 2, and also satisfies criterion 3.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{get_pkeys} to determine primary key columns, which are excluded from the modality check.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (assuming get_pkeys is defined):
# df <- data.frame(Plot = c(1,1,2,2), Year = c(2000,2001,2000,2001), Value = c(5,6,7,8))
# is_plot_like(df, "Plot", "Year")
