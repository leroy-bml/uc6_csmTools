\title{Check if a Column is Crop-Like}
\usage{
is_crop_like(df, col_name, plot_col, year_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the data to be checked.}

\item{col_name}{The name of the focal column (as a string).}

\item{plot_col}{The name of the plot column (as a string).}

\item{year_col}{The name of the year column (as a string).}
}
\value{
Logical. \code{TRUE} if the column is crop-like, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Determines whether a column in a data frame is "crop-like" based on two criteria:
\enumerate{
\item For each year, the column must have at least two unique non-NA values and at least one value must be reused across plots (i.e., not all values are unique within a year).
\item plot-column associations must change within blocks of consecutive years (crop rotation), as determined by \code{\link{check_consecutive_treatment_blocks}}.
}
}
\details{
The function first checks that, for each year, the focal column has at least two unique non-NA values and that at least one value is reused across plots.
It then checks that plot-column associations change between consecutive years using \code{\link{check_consecutive_treatment_blocks}}.

# Example usage:
# df <- data.frame(
#   Plot = c(1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2),
#   Year = c(2000,2001,2000,2001,2003,2004,2003,2004),
#   Treatment = c('A','B','B','C','C','D','D','A')
# )
# is_crop_like(df, col_name = "Treatment", plot_col = "Plot", year_col = "Year")
