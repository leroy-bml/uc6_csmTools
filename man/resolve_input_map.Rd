\title{Resolve an Input Map to a List of Data Vectors}
\usage{
resolve_input_map(input_map, df)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_map}{A named list from a YAML rule where keys are local names and values are column specifications
(e.g., \verb{\{x: colA, y: \{header: colB\}\}}).}

\item{df}{The data frame from which to pull the column vectors.}
}
\value{
A named list of data vectors (e.g., \code{list(x=c(1,2), y=c(3,4))}), or \code{NULL} if any column cannot be resolved.
}
\description{
Resolves a list of column specifications from a YAML rule against a data frame, extracting the corresponding data vectors.
}
\details{
This helper function is used by actions that require multiple inputs. It iterates through the \code{input_map}, uses
\code{resolve_column_name()} to find each column (handling synonyms), and returns a named list of the actual data vectors.
It is designed to fail gracefully by returning \code{NULL} if any specified column is not found.
