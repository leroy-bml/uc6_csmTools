\title{Revert a List of Named Lists to a List of Lists by Element}
\usage{
revert_list_str(ls)
}
\arguments{
\item{ls}{A list of named lists, all with the same names.}
}
\value{
A list of lists, where each element corresponds to a name in the original named lists and contains a list of values for that name across all input lists.
}
\description{
Transposes a list of named lists so that each element of the output list contains the values for a given name across all input lists.
}
\details{
This function takes a list of named lists (e.g., the result of splitting a data frame by row and converting each row to a named list) and transposes it. The result is a list where each element is a list of the values for a particular name across all input lists.

This is the inverse operation of splitting a data frame into a list of named lists by row, and is useful for reconstructing column-wise lists from row-wise lists.

\examples{
input <- list(
  list(a = 1, b = "x"),
  list(a = 2, b = "y"),
  list(a = 3, b = "z")
)
revert_list_str(input)
# Returns a list: $a = list(1, 2, 3), $b = list("x", "y", "z")
