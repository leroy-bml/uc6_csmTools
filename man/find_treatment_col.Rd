\title{Find Treatment-Like Columns in a Data Frame}
\usage{
find_treatment_col(df, plot_col, year_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame to search for treatment-like columns.}

\item{plot_col}{The name of the plot column (as a string).}

\item{year_col}{The name of the year column (as a string).}
}
\value{
A character vector of column names in \code{df} that are treatment-like.
}
\description{
Identifies columns in a data frame that are "treatment-like" according to the \code{\link{is_treatment_like}} function.
A treatment-like column is one that has at least two unique non-NA values per year, at least one value reused across plots within a year, and consistent plot-to-treatment associations within blocks of consecutive years.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (assuming is_treatment_like and check_consecutive_treatment_blocks are defined):
# df <- data.frame(
#   Plot = c(1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2),
#   Year = c(2000,2001,2000,2001,2003,2004,2003,2004),
#   Treatment = c('A','A','B','B','C','C','D','D')
# )
# find_treatment_col(df, plot_col = "Plot", year_col = "Year")
