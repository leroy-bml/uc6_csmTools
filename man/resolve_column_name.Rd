\title{Find a Column Name from a Set of Possible Names}
\usage{
resolve_column_name(name_spec, available_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{name_spec}{A character vector of possible names, or a list with \verb{$header} and/or \verb{$synonyms} elements.}

\item{available_cols}{A character vector of column names to search within (e.g., from \code{colnames(df)}).}
}
\value{
A character string of the first matching column name, or \code{NULL} if no match is found.
}
\description{
Searches for a matching name in a vector of available column names, based on a flexible specification that can include
a primary name and synonyms.
}
\details{
This function resolves a desired column name against a list of existing columns. It provides a flexible way to find a
column when its name might vary.
\itemize{
\item The \code{name_spec} argument defines the set of names to search for.
\item If \code{name_spec} is a list, it is expected to have elements like \verb{$header} (the canonical name) and \verb{$synonyms}
(a vector of alternative names). All are pooled together for the search.
\item If \code{name_spec} is a character vector, it is used directly as the set of possible names.
\item The function returns the \emph{first} match found in \code{available_cols}.
}
