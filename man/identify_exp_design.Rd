\title{Identify Experimental Design Structure in a Database}
\usage{
identify_exp_design(db, design_tbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{A list of data frames representing the database.}

\item{design_tbl}{A data frame containing the experimental design information.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data frame summarizing the year, plot, and treatment components, their associated table names, ID column names, and counts/ranges.
}
\description{
Identifies and summarizes the year, plot, and treatment structure of an experimental design from a database and a design table.
The function prints summaries of year, plot, and treatment attributes, including their ranges and associated tables, and returns a summary data frame (invisibly).
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Identifies the year column and summarizes the range of years.
\item Identifies the plot column, summarizes the number and range of plots per year, and prints the associated table.
\item Identifies the treatment column, summarizes the number and range of treatments per year, and prints the associated table.
}
Helper functions such as \code{find_year_col}, \code{find_plot_col}, \code{find_treatment_col}, \code{count_per_year}, \code{get_tbl}, and \code{get_df_name} are used internally.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (assuming all helper functions are defined):
# db <- list(
#   plots = data.frame(Plot = 1:4, ...),
#   treatments = data.frame(Treatment = c("A", "B"), ...)
# )
# design_tbl <- data.frame(Year = rep(2000:2002, each = 4), Plot = rep(1:4, 3), Treatment = sample(c("A", "B"), 12, TRUE))
# identify_exp_design(db, design_tbl)
