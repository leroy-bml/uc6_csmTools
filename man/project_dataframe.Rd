\title{Split a Data Frame into Multiple Sub-Data Frames by Group Mapping}
\usage{
project_dataframe(df, map)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame to be split. Columns in this data frame should correspond to the \code{icasa_header_long} values in \code{map}.}

\item{map}{A data frame containing at least the columns \code{icasa_group} and \code{icasa_header_long}. This mapping defines which columns in \code{df} belong to which group.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames. Each element corresponds to a group defined in \code{map$icasa_group}, containing the relevant columns from \code{df}.
}
\description{
This function splits a data frame into a list of sub-data frames based on groupings defined in a mapping data frame.
Each sub-data frame contains columns associated with a specific group, as well as any columns not assigned to any group (i.e., with \code{NA} as group).
}
\details{
The function works as follows:
\itemize{
\item It filters the \code{map} data frame to include only those rows where \code{icasa_header_long} matches a column in \code{df}.
\item It identifies all unique, non-\code{NA} group names from \code{icasa_group}.
\item Columns with \code{NA} in \code{icasa_group} are considered "no-group" columns and are included in every sub-data frame.
\item For each identified group, a sub-data frame is created containing all columns mapped to that group, plus all "no-group" columns.
\item The result is a named list of sub-data frames, with names corresponding to the group names.
}
