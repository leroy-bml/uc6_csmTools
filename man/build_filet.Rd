\title{Format observed time-series table list as a DSSAT input file format}
\usage{
build_filet(ls, title = NULL, site_code = NA_character_)
}
\arguments{
\item{ls}{A named list containing at least a \code{"TIME_SERIES"} data frame.}

\item{title}{Character or NULL. Optional title for the file (not currently used).}

\item{site_code}{Character or NA. Optional site code (not currently used).}
}
\value{
A formatted data frame ready for DSSAT time series file writing, with formatting attributes attached.
}
\description{
Formats a time series observed data frame from a list into the DSSAT
time series file structure, applying date formatting and setting file attributes.
}
\details{
The function extracts the \code{"TIME_SERIES"} data frame from the list, formats the \code{DATE} column as DSSAT day-of-year strings, arranges by treatment and date, and applies the \code{as_DSSAT_tbl} function. It sets the \code{v_fmt} attribute for variable formatting, using only those formats present in the data.

This is useful for preparing observed time series data for writing to a DSSAT-compatible file.
