\title{Ensure Required DSSAT/GLUE Files Are Present in the GLUE Directory}
\usage{
check_glue_files(dir_dssat, dir_glue)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir_dssat}{Character. Path to the DSSAT installation directory containing required files.}

\item{dir_glue}{Character. Path to the GLUE working directory where files should be present.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Used for its side effect of copying files if needed.
}
\description{
Checks for the presence of required DSSAT/GLUE files in the GLUE directory and copies them from the DSSAT directory if missing.
}
\details{
The function determines the operating system and sets the list of required files accordingly. It checks for each required file in \code{dir_glue}, and if a file is missing, it copies it from \code{dir_dssat}. This ensures that all necessary files for GLUE-based DSSAT simulations are available in the working directory.
