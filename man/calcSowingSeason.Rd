\usage{
calcSowingSeason(
  sowing_date,
  croppar,
  monthly_temp,
  monthly_ppet,
  seasonality,
  lat
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sowing_date}{Date. The sowing date.}

\item{croppar}{A list or data frame containing crop-specific temperature thresholds, including \code{basetemp.low}, \code{temp_fall}, and \code{temp_spring}.}

\item{monthly_temp}{Numeric vector of length 12. Average monthly temperatures (Â°C) for each month (January to December).}

\item{monthly_ppet}{Numeric vector of length 12. Average monthly precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P-PET) values for each month.}

\item{seasonality}{Character. The type of seasonality, e.g., \code{"TEMP"}, \code{"TEMPPREC"}, \code{"PRECTEMP"}, or \code{"PREC"}.}

\item{lat}{Numeric. Latitude of the location (not currently used in the function, but included for extensibility).}
}
\value{
A character string indicating the sowing season ("winter", "spring", "wet season", "dry season", or "unknown").
}
\description{
Determines the sowing season (e.g., "winter", "spring", "wet season", "dry season") for a given sowing date, based on crop parameters, monthly climate data, and seasonality type.
}
\details{
The function determines the sowing season by comparing the sowing month to the coldest and warmest months (based on \code{monthly_temp}) and by evaluating the seasonality type. For temperature-based seasonality, sowing before the coldest month is classified as "winter", otherwise as "spring". For precipitation-based seasonality, months with \code{monthly_ppet > 0.5} are considered the "wet season", others as "dry season". If the seasonality type is unrecognized, the function returns "unknown".

\examples{
sowing_date <- as.Date("2022-10-15")
croppar <- list(basetemp.low = 5, temp_fall = 10, temp_spring = 15)
monthly_temp <- c(2, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 22, 21, 17, 12, 7, 3)
monthly_ppet <- c(-10, -8, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 12, 7, 2, -3, -8)
calcSowingSeason(sowing_date, croppar, monthly_temp, monthly_ppet, "TEMP", 45)
# Returns "winter" or "spring" depending on the sowing month
