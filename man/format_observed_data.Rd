\title{Format and Merge Observed Data Sections in a List}
\usage{
format_observed_data(ls)
}
\arguments{
\item{ls}{A named list of data frames, typically representing sections of an experimental template, including observed data tables.}
}
\value{
The input list with merged "SUMMARY" and "TIME_SERIES" data frames, and observed data tables removed.
}
\description{
Merges related observed data tables (e.g., summary and time series) in a list of data frames, producing unified "SUMMARY" and "TIME_SERIES" sections.
}
\details{
The function searches for tables in the list whose names match "SM_" (summary) or "TS_" (time series), as well as "OBSERV_DATA_LINKS". It merges these tables by their common columns using \code{left_join}, producing unified "SUMMARY" and "TIME_SERIES" data frames. If the merged table has the same columns as "OBSERV_DATA_LINKS", it is omitted (returns \code{NULL}).

After merging, the function removes all original observed data tables (those matching "SM_", "TS_", or "OBS") from the list, leaving only the merged "SUMMARY" and "TIME_SERIES" sections.

The function uses the \strong{dplyr} package for joining data frames.
