\title{Extract and Organize Code Lists from a the ICASA Template Workbook}
\usage{
get_template_codes(wb)
}
\arguments{
\item{wb}{A workbook object, as accepted by \code{wb_to_df}.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, each representing a code list from the template workbook.
}
\description{
Reads code lists from the "DropDown" sheet of the ICASA template workbook and organizes them into a named list of data frames.
}
\details{
The function reads the "DropDown" sheet from the provided workbook, starting from the second row. It removes columns ending with \code{\"_sort\"} (used for data entry helpers), then splits the remaining columns into separate data frames for each code list, based on column name prefixes. Each resulting data frame contains at least a "desc" (description) and "code" column, and is named according to its prefix. The "country" code list is excluded from the result.

This is useful for extracting and organizing code lists from standardized data entry templates.

The function uses the \strong{dplyr} package for data manipulation.

\dontrun{
wb <- openxlsx::loadWorkbook(\"template.xlsx\")

# [1] \"crop\" \"soil\" \"site\" ...
}
