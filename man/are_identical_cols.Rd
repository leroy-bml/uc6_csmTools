\title{Test if Two Vectors are Identical (with NA Handling and Normalization)}
\usage{
are_identical_cols(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{The first vector to compare.}

\item{b}{The second vector to compare.}
}
\value{
Logical. \code{TRUE} if the vectors are identical in length, content, and \code{NA} positions, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
This function compares two vectors to determine if they are functionally identical.
The comparison includes handling of \code{NA} values and standardize values (e.g., by trimming whitespace)
before comparison.
}
\details{
The function operates with the following logic:
\itemize{
\item It first checks if the vectors have different lengths. If so, it returns \code{FALSE} immediately.
\item It then handles the special case where both vectors are entirely composed of \code{NA} values, returning \code{TRUE}.
\item The content of both vectors are then standardized (i.e., by trimming leading/trailing whitespace and coercing to character type).
\item It performs an element-wise comparison. An \code{NA} in one vector is considered a match if and only if the other vector also has an \code{NA} in the same position.
\item If any element-wise comparison results in \code{FALSE} (and is not an \code{NA}), the function returns \code{FALSE}. Otherwise, it returns \code{TRUE}.
}

This function is useful for robustly comparing columns in a data frame, where minor formatting differences
(like whitespace) should be ignored and \code{NA} values should be treated as matches.
