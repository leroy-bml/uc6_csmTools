\title{Format management table list as a DSSAT input file format (file X)}
\usage{
build_filex(management_data, title = NULL, site_code = NA_character_)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{Character or NULL. Optional title for the file (not currently used).}

\item{site_code}{Character or NA. Optional site code (not currently used).}

\item{ls}{A named list containing at least a \code{"MANAGEMENT"} data frame or list of management sections.}
}
\value{
A named list of formatted management sections, ready for DSSAT File X writing, with metadata attributes attached.
}
\description{
Assembles and formats all management sections into a DSSAT File X structure,
applying templates, setting defaults, and preserving metadata.
}
\details{
The function extracts the \code{"MANAGEMENT"} section, applies the appropriate template to each management section, and sets default values for missing parameters in the treatments matrix. It checks for required sections and fills them with template defaults if missing, issuing warnings as needed. The resulting list is ordered according to the template and has relevant attributes transferred from the original data.

This is useful for preparing a complete DSSAT File X (management file) for writing to disk.
