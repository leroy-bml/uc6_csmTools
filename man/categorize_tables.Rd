\title{Categorize Data Frames in a Database List Based on Referential Relationships}
\usage{
categorize_tables(db)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{A named list of data frames, where each data frame represents a table in the database.
Table names are expected as the names of the list elements.}
}
\value{
A named character vector where names are the data frame (table) names from \code{db},
and values are their assigned categories:
* \strong{"root"}: Tables that are referenced by other tables but do not themselves reference any other tables within \code{db}.
* \strong{"branch"}: Tables that both reference other tables and are referenced by other tables within \code{db}.
* \strong{"leaf"}: Tables that reference other tables but are not referenced by any other tables within \code{db}.
* \strong{"standalone"}: Tables that neither reference nor are referenced by any other tables within \code{db}.
Returns \code{character(0)} if the input \code{db} is invalid or empty.
}
\description{
This function analyzes a named list of data frames (representing tables in a database)
and categorizes each table based on its referential relationships with other tables in the list.
It identifies whether a table is a "root," "branch," "leaf," or "standalone" table.
}
\details{
The categorization relies on two main criteria for each table:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Is it referencing another table in \code{db}?} This is determined by calling the \code{get_parents()} helper function
on the current data frame against the entire \code{db} list. \code{get_parents()} is expected to identify if the current
table contains foreign keys that point to primary keys in other tables within \code{db}.
\item \strong{Is it referenced by another table in \code{db}?} This is determined by checking if the current table's name
appears in the list of all tables that are identified as "parents" by any other table in \code{db}.
}

Based on these two criteria, each table is assigned one of the four categories.
The function relies on the \code{get_parents()} helper function to correctly identify parent relationships.
