\title{Plot Simulated and Observed Plant Growth Output}
\usage{
plot_output(sim_output)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_output}{A list containing simulation output and observed data, as returned by \code{run_simulations}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing simulated and observed plant growth for each treatment.
}
\description{
Creates a plot comparing simulated and observed plant growth (e.g., yield) for different treatments.
}
\details{
The function extracts observed summary data and simulated plant growth data from \code{sim_output}, formats dates, and creates a ggplot showing simulated growth as lines and observed data as points. The plot distinguishes treatments by color and includes custom legends for simulated and observed data.

The function uses the \strong{dplyr} and \strong{ggplot2} packages for data manipulation and plotting.
