\title{Combine List Elements with Duplicate Names by Merging Data Frames}
\usage{
combine_dual_tier(ls)
}
\arguments{
\item{ls}{A named list of data frames, possibly containing multiple data frames with the same name.}
}
\value{
A named list of merged data frames, one for each unique name in the input list.
}
\description{
Merges data frames in a list that share the same name, joining them by their common columns.
}
\details{
The function identifies all unique names in the list. For each name, it collects all data frames with that name, determines their common columns, and merges them using \code{merge} with \code{all = TRUE} (full outer join) on the common columns. The result is a new list with one merged data frame per unique name.

This is useful for consolidating data from dual-tier or multi-section templates where sections may be split across multiple data frames with the same name.

\examples{
df1 <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = c(\"x\", \"y\"))
df2 <- data.frame(a = 3:4, b = c(\"z\", \"w\"))
ls <- list(SECTION = df1, SECTION = df2)
combine_dual_tier(ls)
# Returns a list with one element \"SECTION\", containing the merged data frame
